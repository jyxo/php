Jyxo PHP Library
================

Welcome to Jyxo PHP Library.

A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away... there has been an IT company
called Jyxo s.r.o. It has existed for several years and created and contributed
to numerous projects.

To share fruits of work of individual project teams and to not re-invent
the wheel over and over again, a collection of libraries has been created.
It has been given the name "Jyxo PHP Library" and it has happily grown throughout
the years.

One day, a couple of company developers came with the idea to make it open
source and publish it on github. It took some time, some management decisions,
but we've made it. And here we are :)

In this repository we will continuously publish various bits and pieces from
this library. We will do our best to publish everything that would be useful
to anyone from the outside world. It will be kind of long run, since many
parts will have to be cleaned and polished first and above all - we have to
translate docblocks and comments to English first :)

A big part of the library will also be covered by PHPUnit tests.

The code you find here is in actual use in various projects and to the best
of our knowledge, it can be considered stable. But as always, read the License
first.
